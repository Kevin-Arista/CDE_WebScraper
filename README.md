# Proof of Concept:

### How to Webscrape

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have proper priveledges / permission before scraping any data, as it may be considered personal identifiable information (PII).
Make sure to read: https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/di/ws/webpolicy.asp before attempting to execute code.

The following code was created for research demonstration purposes.
The motive behind writing this program was to demonstrate the reader of my Zine:
"Segmentation Fault: a mini overview about the ENOURMOUS problem in our segmented education system" how they can apply python to automate and search for data such as enrollment reports by ethnicity, or proficiency levels of non-native english speakers, CAASPP reports, etc. and identify any patterns that may be rooted deeply within the fund distrubution system, in an attempty to address the need for _equitable education_.

The `reCAPTCHA.html` that I included in the repo is just so people know what it
looks like for a bot to not be able to solve a reCAPTCHA on it's own.
